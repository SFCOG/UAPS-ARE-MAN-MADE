# UAP and UFO Origin Exposed

## How UAPs Actually Work
Please refer to the PDFs and other documents in this repository for the mathematical and physical evidence that supports the following postulations. All apparent observations of UAP performance and flight capabilities can be explained simply using orbital mechanics, tensile strength of materials, and good old-fashioned ingenuity.

## Who:
A foreign adversary with space capabilities, involving a significant number of recent space launches and payloads. This adversary is known for its high-tech manufacturing capabilities and a strong desire to use surveillance as a means to collect intelligence. They may also possess extensive experience in entertainment, including the use of invisible wires for various purposes.

## What:
Lightweight surveillance probes suspended by invisible woven fiber-optic cables. These high-strength data transmission cables are lowered or dropped from low Earth geosynchronous orbit satellites.

## Why:
The purpose is to collect military and industrial data.

## How:
Sensor probes may come in various designs and configurations, including single tether and multi-tether setups that can be implemented with small maneuverable satellites. The probes are allowed to spool ahead of the satellite by many miles, and the invisible clear glass cables are kept taut, allowing the maneuvering of a probe to be a matter of simply using compressed air thrusters. Refer to the included documents for more details.

#### Theory and Applications of Multi-Tethers in Space
Fan Zhang, Panfeng Huang

This book offers a comprehensive overview of recently developed space multi-tethers, such as maneuverable space tethered nets and space tethered formation. For each application, it provides detailed derivatives to describe and analyze the mathematical model of the system, and then discusses the design and proof of different control schemes for various problems. The dynamics modeling presented is based on Newton and Lagrangian mechanics, and the book also introduces Hamilton mechanics and Poincar√© surface of section for dynamics analysis, and employs both centralized and distributed controllers to derive the formation question of the multi-tethered system. In addition to the equations and text, it includes 3D design drawings, schematic diagrams, control scheme blocks and tables to make it easy to understand. This book is intended for researchers and graduate students in the fields of astronautics, control science, and engineering.
